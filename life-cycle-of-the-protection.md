## Life cycle of the protection

In a normal boot, the page table based protection is configured by the PiSmmCpu driver just after the SmmReadyToLock event by `PerformRemainingTasks()` at [https:\/\/github.com\/tianocore\/edk2\/blob\/master\/UefiCpuPkg\/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm\/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm.c](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm.c). All read-only data must be ready before `SmmReadyToLock`.

In an S3 resume, the protection is disabled during SMBASE relocation because the PiSmmCpu needs to set up the environment. The PiSmmCpu uses SmmS3Cr3, which is generated by `InitSmmS3Cr3()` at [https:\/\/github.com\/tianocore\/edk2\/blob\/master\/UefiCpuPkg\/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm\/X64\/SmmProfileArch.c](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/X64/SmmProfileArch.c)  with 4G paging only. After the SMBASE relocation is done, all the protection takes effect up receipt of the next SMI by `PerformPreTasks()` at [https:\/\/github.com\/tianocore\/edk2\/blob\/master\/UefiCpuPkg\/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm\/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm.c](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm.c).

If there is an additional lock that needs to be set, it can be done in `SmmCpuFeaturesCompleteSmmReadyToLock()` API \(defined in [https:\/\/github.com\/tianocore\/edk2\/blob\/master\/UefiCpuPkg\/Include\/Library\/SmmCpuFeaturesLib.h](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/Include/Library/SmmCpuFeaturesLib.h)\).
