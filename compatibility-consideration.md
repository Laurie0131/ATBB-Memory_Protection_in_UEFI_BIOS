## Compatibility Consideration

A platform may need to evaluate and select the image protection policy based upon the capability of the platform image, Option ROM, and OS loader. For platform images, the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) and the EDK-I Compatibility Package (ECP) modules should be considered. If a platform observes the compatibility issues, it should choose 1) to disable the protection, or 2) to fix the compatibility issue and enable the protection.
