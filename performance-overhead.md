## Performance Overhead

1. The SMRAM protection setup is a one-time activity. It happens just after the SmmReadyToLock event. We do not observe too much impact to the system firmware boot performance. The activity only takes some small number of milliseconds.

2. The SMRAM runtime protection is based upon the page table. No additional CPU instruction is needed. As such, there is zero SMM runtime performance impact to have this protection.
